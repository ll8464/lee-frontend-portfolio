# lee-frontend-portfolio

Hello!

This portfolio's background was made utilizing the web tool https://app.haikei.app/ to make the vibrant waves seen.

The CSS was made via SASS while the Contact page is live via netlify forms.

# This branch is for development.

## Ideas

### The Projects Section could use refinement:

- The Projects section is the most crucial, so it should be moved to the first/second section.
- A Swiper carousel could be used at smaller media queries.
- The Cards for the projects needs individual containers to make them easier to manipulate.
  - The text and button locations are inconsistent at larger sizes.
- Update the projects to more recent endeavors

* The buttons should be rounded like the cards, or both the cards and the buttons should edged.
* The img of each card should have a slight shadow effect.

### The Contact

- A color change to match the scheme
- Make the captcha fit the Card better.
  - Make sure there is a proper container div for the captcha card.

### Introduction

- The introduction section is serviceable.
- It is an opportunity to show animations.
- The navbar could contain links to my social media/github.

### Overall

- A new color scheme may be in order. More muted colors/styling so the project can stand out more.
- Could redesign the page to be more of a modern blog style.
